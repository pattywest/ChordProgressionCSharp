# ChordProgressionC#

<h3><b>My First C# Project:</b></h3>

A program that allows a user to enter an amount of chords they want in a progression, then enter if the key is Major or Minor, and will give a chord progression that follows the rules taught to me in Music Theory.

Future Additions:
<s>
- Basic functionality, randomly produce a chord progression based on a starting chord. </s>
- Add the user putting in an ending chord, and making sure all the rules still apply.
<s>
- Adding inversions, which would also be random. </s>

- Add an array to try and weight some chords over others, i.e. a V chord would have a higher shot of going to a I or IV over the others.
